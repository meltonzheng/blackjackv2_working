Blackjack game works with two players. No optimizations.

Optimizations needed:
	Player class so that I don't need to create 5 views, 5 scenes, indices, etc for them each time.
	Buttons still work for some reason after the game is over...
	Create a game w more than 2 players
	Create a game w AI
		OPTIMIZATIONS:	
			here we can do machine learning
			perhaps do more here
	Create a game w money/points involved
	Cover the cards w something so that one player can't see the other player's cards
